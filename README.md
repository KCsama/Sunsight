Hello, this is a project I did for the class CS160 project 1.

Our task is to design an application for the hikers.

This is the first time I worked with HTML so I relied on a lot of tutorials which is referenced in the report pdf. All usages of pictures are also referenced in the report pdf.

If you clone the repo, you can access the web app through running "node App.js". However, you must have Node and npm installed on your computer for the web app to run properly.
